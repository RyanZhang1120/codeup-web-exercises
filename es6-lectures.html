  //This is a great example of 'syntactical sugar' - no REINVENTION of the wheel, a REFINEMENT of the wheel ("Write less, do more" kind of idea"

  //in the before times: we would need to call the Math objects .pow method and add two arguments to get a return of the correct result of the math
  // Math.pow(num, num)

  //es6: new operator saves us some typing
  // num ** num
